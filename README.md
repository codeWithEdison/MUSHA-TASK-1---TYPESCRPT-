### **Exercise 2 â€” Mushroom Identification (TypeScript)**  

The purpose of this exercise is to write a **TypeScript program** that asks questions to the user in order to guess which mushroom the user has in mind (among a list of six known mushrooms).  

To identify the user's chosen mushroom, the program can ask **at most 3 yes/no questions** (where the user will respond with `yes` or `no`).  

#### **The 6 possible mushrooms are:**  
- **Yellow Agaric**  
- **Fly Agaric**  
- **Porcini Mushroom**  
- **Hairy Coprin**  
- **Cantharellus Cibarius**  
- **Wood Blewit**  

#### **Rules for identification:**  
1. **The Porcini Mushroom** is the only one with **pores**; all the others have **gills**.  
2. **Hairy Coprin** and **Yellow Agaric** grow in **meadows**, while the others grow in **woods**.  
3. The only mushrooms with a **convex cap** are **Yellow Agaric, Fly Agaric, and Wood Blewit**.  
4. The only mushrooms with a **ring** are **Yellow Agaric, Fly Agaric, and Porcini Mushroom**.  

Your task is to write a **TypeScript program** that finds the correct mushroom based on these conditions, using **at most 3 questions** to determine the correct answer. The program should use a decision-tree approach to minimize the number of questions asked.

This exercise will help you practice **decision structures**, **conditional logic**, and **user interaction in TypeScript**. Good luck! ðŸš€
